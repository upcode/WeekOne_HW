<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>URGENT</em> Another report needed for CEO!

Hello and welcome aboard!

We here at Ubermelon strongly believe that the best way to on-board new
developers is to get them involved in our codebase immediately.
The first assignment we need you to help us with comes directly from
the CEO himself.

He needs a report that displays sales information for Monday. Since I
don't have time to handle this myself, I thought it'd be a great first
ticket for you. I've attached a file called process.py that seems to
display sales information for Tuesday. It would help if you could step
through this file and make any necessary adjustments for it to display
what Mel wants instead of the information it currently displays.

Attached is also the latest log file, which has the week's sales
information in it.

Thanks for your help,
Mel
Team Lead
