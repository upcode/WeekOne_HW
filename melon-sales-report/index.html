<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>URGENT</em> Accounting help needed!

OH NO!! The CEO has JUST informed me last night that our
accounting team was poached by Chad from Squysh.

Fortunately, I was able to get some new dev hires today
from a local bootcamp. They are even less experienced than
you--but their rates are highly competitive
(see <a class="reference external" href="new-dev-team.png">attachment</a>).

There is still an issue though. Before they officially joined
today, I ended up having to write some code myself, to
basically do the job the four accountants were doing.

I think my code looks great, but the problem is that my new
jr. jr. programming team does not understand my code.

Can you help rewrite it so that it's more understandable?
I've also been told that my code isn't very &quot;professional&quot;
and &quot;clean,&quot; :( so that might be something else to work on.


Here's what the code does:

* Counts the amounts of each type of melon that were sold
* Calculates the revenue from those melon tallies
* Separates sales into online sales and phone sales
* Produces fancy report to summarize the info for our CEO

Ordering tasks into their own functions would be a great
start!


Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead
